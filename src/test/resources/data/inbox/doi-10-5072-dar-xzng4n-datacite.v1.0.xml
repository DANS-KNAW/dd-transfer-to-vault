        <description descriptionType="Abstract">The BAFACALO&apos;s dataset presents answers from 292 Brazilian high-school students from a public school to 18 cognitive tests developed to assess different hierarchical levels of the intelligence structure. Most of the participants were girls (53.40%) and their age ranged from 14 to 20 years old (Mean = 15.71, Standard Deviation = 1.15). The BAFACALO&apos;s tests were constructed by Gomes (2005, 2010) based on the Educational Testing Service&apos;s Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests (Ekstrom, French, Harman &amp; Dirmen, 1976).</description>
