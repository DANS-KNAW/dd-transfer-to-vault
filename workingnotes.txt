working notes for adding new vault catalog api support

current situation
- collect task gets basic metadata and creates transferitem record
- extractmetadata task gets more metadata and updates transferitem record
- ocfltartask collects a bunch of these transfer items and creates a tar entity
- this is then sent to the vault catalog

new situation
- collect task collects bag, creates record in vault catalog with basic info
- extractmetadata task gets more metadata and updates vault catalog record (and also internal record)
- ocfltartask collects a bunch of these transfer items and creates a tar entity
- once the tar is created, it is done? verify this. Or can a tar be re-created for some reason
- ocfltartask creates tar in vault catalog, but the ocfl objects should already exist there

todos
create a new interface with the catalog api
have methods:
 - create ocfl version
 - update ocfl version
 - create tar
 - move vault catalog config to top level config


notes
everything coming from sword2 has a unique bag id
if it is an update to an existing bag, it will have a different bag id
the sword token might be the same, and it is an update, but it will have


when an identical rda bag is deposited, the bag ID is only read in the ExtractMetadataTask
but the step before it (collect) checks if the bag already exists, and throws an error if it does
so think about how to prevent this issue, or reason about why it is not an issue
